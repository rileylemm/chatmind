# üß† 3D Graph Interface Plan

A roadmap for integrating a 3D visualization mode into ChatMind using `react-force-graph-3d`. This feature will provide an immersive and interactive way to explore knowledge graphs built from ChatGPT data.

---

## üéØ Objective

Create a fully interactive 3D graph view that visualizes:

- **Chats ‚Üí Messages ‚Üí Chunks ‚Üí Tags**
- Semantic clusters and topic gravity centers
- Layer toggles between raw data and semantic overlays

## üß± MVP Milestone (v1)

### Features

- [ ] Render 3D force-directed graph
- [ ] Map data from `/api/graph` to nodes and links
- [ ] Use node types (chat, message, chunk, tag) for:
  - Shape (sphere, box, etc.)
  - Color coding
  - Sizing
- [ ] Zoom, rotate, drag interaction
- [ ] Node labels on hover
- [ ] Click node to display metadata

### File: `frontend/src/components/Graph3D.tsx`

```tsx
import ForceGraph3D from 'react-force-graph-3d';
