# Discovery Flows Development Plan

**ChatMind Frontend Discovery Features**

This document outlines the development plan for three powerful discovery flows that will help users explore unexpected connections and insights in their ChatGPT conversation data.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The discovery flows are designed to surface **unexpected connections** and **hidden patterns** in your ChatGPT conversations, going beyond simple search to reveal insights you didn't know you had.

### Core Philosophy
- **Discovery over Search**: Find what you didn't know you were looking for
- **Connection over Isolation**: Show how seemingly unrelated topics connect
- **Insight over Data**: Transform raw conversations into actionable insights

---

## ðŸ”— Flow 1: Connection Discovery

### Purpose
Find unexpected connections between conversations across different domains and topics.

### User Journey
1. **Entry Point**: User clicks "Discover Connections" or sees a suggestion
2. **Topic Selection**: User enters a topic (e.g., "stress", "python", "health")
3. **Cross-Domain Results**: System shows how the topic appears across different domains
4. **Connection Explanation**: User can click to see "why" conversations are connected
5. **Exploration**: User can dive deeper into related conversations

### Frontend Implementation

#### Main Discovery View
```typescript
interface ConnectionDiscoveryView {
  // Search input for topic
  topicInput: string;
  
  // Results organized by domain
  crossDomainResults: {
    [domain: string]: {
      chat_id: string;
      title: string;
      content: string;
      similarity: number;
    }[];
  };
  
  // Connection explanations
  explanations: {
    source_chat: Chat;
    target_chat: Chat;
    shared_themes: string[];
    connection_strength: number;
    explanation: string;
  }[];
}
```

#### Key Components
1. **Topic Search Bar**
   - Auto-complete with popular topics
   - Real-time search suggestions
   - Search history

2. **Domain Results Grid**
   - Cards for each domain (health, business, technology, etc.)
   - Preview of conversations in each domain
   - Similarity scores and connection indicators

3. **Connection Explanation Modal**
   - Visual representation of shared themes
   - Connection strength indicator
   - "Why these are connected" explanation
   - Links to explore both conversations

4. **Exploration Panel**
   - Related conversations
   - Suggested next discoveries
   - Breadcrumb navigation

#### API Integration
```typescript
// Cross-domain search
const crossDomainResults = await fetch(
  `/api/search/cross-domain?query=${topic}&limit=5`
);

// Connection explanation
const explanation = await fetch(
  `/api/connections/explain?source_id=${chat1}&target_id=${chat2}`
);

// Discovery suggestions
const suggestions = await fetch('/api/discover/suggestions?limit=3');
```

### Visual Design
- **Color-coded domains**: Each domain has a distinct color
- **Connection lines**: Visual lines showing relationships
- **Strength indicators**: Opacity/size based on connection strength
- **Interactive cards**: Hover effects and click-to-explore

---

## ðŸ§  Flow 2: Semantic Clustering

### Purpose
Visualize and explore semantic clusters to understand topic patterns and relationships.

### User Journey
1. **Entry Point**: User clicks "Explore Topics" or "View Clusters"
2. **Cluster Overview**: System shows all semantic clusters with positioning
3. **Cluster Selection**: User clicks on a cluster to explore
4. **Cluster Details**: Shows cluster summary, related chunks, and connections
5. **Cluster Connections**: User can see how clusters relate to each other

### Frontend Implementation

#### Cluster Visualization View
```typescript
interface SemanticClusteringView {
  // 2D positioning of clusters
  clusters: {
    cluster_id: string;
    name: string;
    summary: string;
    size: number;
    position: { x: number; y: number };
    connections: string[]; // connected cluster IDs
  }[];
  
  // Selected cluster details
  selectedCluster: {
    cluster_id: string;
    name: string;
    summary: string;
    chunks: Chunk[];
    related_clusters: Cluster[];
  };
}
```

#### Key Components
1. **Cluster Map**
   - 2D scatter plot of clusters
   - Size based on cluster size
   - Color based on domain/topic
   - Connection lines between related clusters

2. **Cluster Details Panel**
   - Cluster summary and name
   - List of chunks in the cluster
   - Related clusters
   - Export/share options

3. **Cluster Explorer**
   - Zoom and pan controls
   - Filter by size, domain, or topic
   - Search within clusters
   - Timeline view of cluster evolution

4. **Cluster Connections**
   - Visual graph of cluster relationships
   - Connection strength indicators
   - Shared themes between clusters

#### API Integration
```typescript
// Get all clusters with positioning
const clusters = await fetch('/api/discover/clusters?include_positioning=true');

// Get cluster details
const clusterDetails = await fetch(`/api/clusters/${clusterId}`);

// Get cluster neighbors
const neighbors = await fetch(`/api/graph/neighbors?node_id=${clusterId}`);
```

### Visual Design
- **Force-directed layout**: Clusters positioned based on relationships
- **Bubble visualization**: Size represents cluster size
- **Color gradients**: Domain-based color coding
- **Connection animations**: Smooth transitions when exploring

3. **Topic Evolution**: User can see how topics evolved over time
4. **Pattern Recognition**: System highlights patterns and trends
5. **Insight Generation**: AI-generated insights about your knowledge journey

### Frontend Implementation

#### Timeline View
```typescript
interface TimelineView {
  // Chronological data with semantic connections
  timeline: {
    date: string;
    conversations: {
      chat_id: string;
